// Create a class named Member having the following members:
// 1 - Name
// 2 - Agey
// 3 - Phone number
// 4 - Address
// 5 - Salary
// It also has a method named printSalary() which prints the salary of the members. Two classes 
// Employee and Manager inherit the Member class. The Employee and Manager classes have 
// data members specialization and department respectively. Now, assign name, age, 
// phone_number, address and salary to an Employee and Manager by making an object of both 
// of these classes and print the same along with specialization and department respectively.
